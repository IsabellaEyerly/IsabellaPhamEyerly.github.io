  <p>
    January 5th, 2026<br>As of today, we have already gone through 1 year of meetings. Currently I am facing issues organizing the schedule because of guest speaker availability and general arrangements. A lot of this was avoidable and I’m unhappy with my commitment. <br><br>Anyway, today I am set to update my documentation by moving it from my google docs to my website. <br><br><br>
    August 31, 2025<br>We have a board meeting at 3 pm today online.<br>Talking pts:<br> - Recap of the past 2 weeks. Take turns<br> - Meeting plans<br> - Guest speakers<br> - Club rush poster by the end of the week. Anyone can make one and we'll vote like last time<br> - Next steps for the next two weeks<br><br><br>
    August 28, 2025 <br>Today I'm starting to contact guest speakers. My list is Steven Spencer, Cutler Crowell, James Abernathy, Christina Gilmore, Mr. Le, Marie K, and Luke Dix. Yarlyne’s contact list is her banking contact, Jocelyn South, Cathryn Burroughs, and Nicole Moersch. <br><br><br>
    August 25, 2025
Ms. Tapia emailed me saying the club process has changed and opens on Wednesday. Specifically something with the advisor agreement. 

I'm doing the meeting plans right now and have a couple things i need the opinion of others on: 
Should we skip the intro meeting?
What sweet treat can we do thatll take less than an hr
What order to put the financial literacy guest speakers and what topics:
Luke dix - insurance?
Mrs south - budgeting
Marie K. - taxes, saving and investing, avoiding financial pitfalls, 
Yarlyne’s contact - banking basics
If i get rid of the intro meeting, should i just get rid of the meeting itself or move everything up? Cause its on halloween so asb will prob have something going on 

Sent the message in the server to ask for everyone else’s opinion. Will report back

Yarlyne suggested we do more for the shrimp ceviche meeting since there are individuals with allergies. I’m thinking sandwiches? Maybe something picnic related? Could do charcuterie board but i hate both of those :( 
August 21, 2025
Turned in advisor agreement and club budget to Mrs. South. She says that she’ll email when she hands it in to whoever is in charge of club stuff. ASB side should be all good to go as soon as they start working on it… 

Notice that Lylia posted a reintroduction but its like the same exact post as a couple months ago. Pictures and everything. Minor differences… 
August 20, 2025
So far I’ve submitted my club constitution and had the advisor agreement signed and now I just have to complete the budget form and submit both the budget and advisor agreement. The google form has been updated too. So all i gotta do is print the budget form and submit both the budget form and advisor agreement tomorrow.
August 19, 2025
Created a 2025-2026 folder and photo folder for this year, creating the meeting plans as I write this. So I got everything ready, like all the dates are there but i can't move on until we have an order settled on which i’ve been asking people and sent out a vote to the discord.
August 14, 2025
Registration at school, Lylia, Yarlyne and I spoke. Same conversation as usual. We rescheduled meeting to 3 pm today

Talking pts:
Documentation
What worked well last yr
what we continue
What we discontinue
Each have a goal for each member. Something realistic
Lesson packages( has a collection of lessons for a specific purpose like dorm life or child care. I remember the child care idea you had clarissa and i really liked it but it took me a while to figure out the best way to insert it without overlapping with other units.
New ideas?
I think every other week would be more convenient for everyone but if we do this, i think we should up the quality of each meeting by having a guest speaker, activity, or something to do every meeting
The board meetings however, let’s make it once a month. We could meet at a cafe. Or something. Do you guys want to carpool after school or go on the weekend?
I didnt want to do this last yr but we can do the food lure thing :( 
Tbh, we don't need a lot of funds
Meeting notes:
Expanding club to after school
Fundraising was good
Guest speaker with food after school only
Meeting after the guest speaker should be working on what they said
Voting 4-6 units
Porter willing to help with guest speakers
Everyone put their goals into the updates channel. I gotta screenshot them and add them











Clarissa
Isabella
Partner with ASB and school to implement an interactive meeting (at least once) about home economics/consumer sciences)
Grow club to ~15-20 members
            












Have 10 different people that don’t include board members come to at least 7 meetings
Have at least 1 guest speaker per unit and at least 1 activity regarding the guest speakers specific topic
No meeting without a guest speaker or activity
Complete writing down the database and start writing lessons
Come up with more lesson packages (dorm life, childcare)
            
Lylia
Yarlyne
Upload on social media once a week
Have at least 10 people coming regularly to meetings
Finish website by club rush
Make the club into a legacy project (find someone to continue it)
Work on symposium speech
Turn the club into more of a workshop type system
             
To arrange guest speakers (arrange people, place, time, food, drinks, etc.)
Help with the website (working on the lessons and adding anything else [she] can for the website that [she] can do)
Fundraising (similar to last year and maybe some fundraising with food places or something similar
Help out anywhere else necessary
            





I personally committed to scheduling the board meetings
We voted on the units to do this year and concluded on civil rights and responsibilities; culinary arts; financial literacy; home maintenance; and communication and etiquette but we recalled a connection we have from last year that could teach us CPR so agreed to add the hygiene and safety unit as well.
 
August 1-2, 2025
It's been a long time since my last update since I haven't done much.

About 1 ½ months ago, I tried to start the curriculum for next year and then realized that no one had responded anything useful to the google form I set up so not only do we have no feedback but we have no way of knowing what they’re interested in next. I stagnated at this point and wanted to expand on the slides we have already done but realized it’d be a waste of time if I wanted the lessons to have more alignment with one another. So instead I wasted my time doing other stuff. I haven't seen any other members documenting so I think they did the same thing but we know I shouldn't assume.

Today and today, lylia reached out to us all, reminding us that we need to assemble to speak about our vision for this next year. We should be meeting after Clarissa settles back home after her vacation. 
I brought up the issue I had with lack of forward thinking regarding the curriculum and have created a spreadsheet to act as our database for the time being. This brought up our website so i recalled why i haven't decided how to make our website yet. The problem with this website is that it’ll need to hold a lot of resources including videos, slideshows, interactives, and a search engine, so customisability needs to be at its highest but if we use a template website like wix, transfer will be extremely difficult later on. Lylia suggested we do a simple mockup on google sites and I agreed it'd be best to use our website as branding for now. Luckily, I realized we could attach the database spreadsheet to the site so now it's sufficient for branding and usage. 
On the website, I put it in our folder, added our logo, made some abstract art for the background, added our vision statement, attached our contact and socials, and some directions for the database section. 

When we have our board meeting, I’d like to talk about these topics:
Guest speakers
Unit selections
Units vs “packages”
Each member’s goals for the year
Documentation

I had two new ideas today.        1. Packages      2. Media connections
info packages which are like a collection of lessons meant for a specific event. for example: "dorm package" it'll have content from many units but will be compiled
Just clips from media displaying the specific skill we’re referring to in the lesson
May 30, 2025
They didn't finish the activity but there was a good sense of community.
May 29, 2025
Made the sewing presentation and tested out the sewing activity. Took ~10 minutes. I think ill leave the presentation on the google classroom but present it fully in-person. Packed everything too.
May 28, 2025
Picked up the cash box in the morning, recounted, and got Mrs. Q’s signature. Brought the cashbox to South and gave her her card and candies. Said bye and such. Good relationship so far.
May 27, 2025
Wrote the cards for Mrs. Saenz and Mrs. South. Had everyone sign it. Delivered to Mrs. Saenz. Yarlyne will deliver to Mrs. South when she delivers the cash box. Cash box hasn't been delivered because Mrs. Q isn't here and it's locked in her safe. Had a school break yesterday btw.
May 25, 2025
Finally moved all the materials inside my house. Haven’t stored them in their TCS box though. Oh! And I found the missing tablecloth.
May 23, 2025
Awful. Had to pack the car, things were slipping, mom was still mad, back hurt. Asked mom about the tablecloth situation and she said she put it in the freezer. Yarlyne showed up at the donut which was weird because she said she can't? It would've been nice if she took some more of the load but I guess our situation is: I drop off at the beginning of the day, she picks up after the event. 

Checked in with Mrs. South, she didn’t have our cashbox ready but said she’ll put it in the office. She emailed me where it’d be.


May 22, 2025
Woke up at 5:30 to harvest as many flowers as I could fit in the bucket. Went well. Collected all the items for event prep, put them in a cardboard box, brought it to school, 
…
I posted 30 more flyers today. I think I've hit my record. 90 flyers. Wow. I feel like I did this really late. Promotion schedule should start ~a week and a half before the event. I haven't even gotten it posted on social media. Here's my idea of what the promotion schedule should be moving forward:
~14 days before the event:
Have all promotion materials ready online (flyers, cards, coupons, signs, etc.)
~13 days before the event:
Send emails to Saenz, Tapia, and Hurlimann for StudentSquare, speaker announcements, and The Sage respectively. Tell them what days to announce the thing.
Post ~90 flyers around the school
Post on social media

~ 11 days before the event:
Send a flyer, qr code of insta, and blurb about the event to all teachers to tell their class. 


Kinda worried about Lylia. No contact for nearly a week online and minimal contact in person as well. Seemed a bit down when last seen. I’ve bought snacks for her today and I'm planning on heading over to her at lunch. She said she’s ok but there’s a lot going on and she feels she hasn’t been keeping up/doing enough but I reassured her that it doesn’t matter if she’s overwhelmed/unwell. She won’t go to the event prep afterschool today but will be going to the event tomorrow. Clarissa realized the art showcase is tonight and has cancelled as well. We’re going to meet in front of the office afterschool today.

Really need good wi-fi to make the cards and I'm kinda struggling right now cause my hotspot is being silly and taking forever to load tabs. Might be because I have 200+ pinterest tabs open… I'll try again and update! So I made a bunch of cards but my hotspot ran out. We’re at about 450+ cards at the moment. I’ll fold what I can. I should’ve done this earlier.

I was about to open everyone else’s documentation documents but they’re not there??? I made it a couple days ago. Where is it? I am on a diff computer right now so that could be the issue but idk. Done.

After school, we got the materials, carpooled to her aunt’s house and her aunt already harvested a bunch of flowers so we started assembling and made a lot of bouquets. We’ve changed the price of individual flowers to be dependent on the flower ($1-5). I’ll update Clarissa and Lylia on how this is gonna work. We have 1 big bucket of arranged bouquets, 1 medium bucket of arranged bouquets, 1 medium bucket of individual flowers, 1 small bucket of filler, 2 cardboard boxes full of succulents. I packed everything ready to go tonight and was too tired to do cards… or make more wrappers… so i'll have to bring it to school tomorrow. Yarlyne told me that she’ll be late since she has a math test and needs extra time. My mom is annoyed that I have to do this all by myself but I really can't do much about other people’s situations. At the same time, I understand and think it’s unfair but it is what it is. Next time I need to ask Clarissa, Lylia, and Yarlyne to help me more. Oh and Yarlyne said that her mom is unavailable now and her aunt is busy and I obviously can’t ask my parents. I told her we’d be fine. Were going to ask Mr. Porter later if that’s ok and I'm pretty sure he's going to be ok with it.
May 21, 2025
Posted 60 flyers but I haven't covered all the areas I wanted to. I think I'll print more and post them tomorrow.

Finished the purpose and price signs online. I finally remembered to keep it at 8x10 instead of 8x11.5. AAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGHHHHH i printed it and width wise, the paper is about 1.5 cm more than it’s supposed to be… I'm reprinting now. It fits. Looks nice, a little off center though. I'll leave it as is for now but if I’m done with the cards, ill redo it.

Researched the differences between Toast, Heartland, and Square and I’ve decided on Square. Here’s why:

When evaluating how good each feature was for our situation, I accounted for how much time, money, and possibility of complication.

Coupons took like 3 hours to do. Printing, cutting, ugh. Still have to verify them.

Printed more flyers too. Estimated to need 27 more so I rounded up to 30 just in case.

Also bought rubber bands. Huge pack. I won’t be reimbursing myself cause i think there’s too many so ill be able to keep it and if i keep it and reimburse it = embezzlement 🤩
May 20, 2025
I’m making cards online today. We sold well and are running low on cards. I printed 20 sheets of coupons(so 120 coupons) and haven't cut or verified them yet. Cards haven't been printed yet and I still need to get rid of the rest of my pinterest tabs with the other card covers, format them, print them, cut them, and fold them, and then I should be good with cards. 

I think I should also send my checklist to the other board members because I have a feeling I'm forgetting stuff… I do need to buy rubber bands though.

Yarlyne texted me asking for updates about the emails for promotion and I completely dropped the ball. I quickly rewrote the emails and we picked out another template to use since I didn't create art for the new design. I have to Remember!! to make the price signs and purpose design for the new style.
May 19, 2025
I asked Yarlyne to send the emails to Saenz, Tapia, and Hurlimann today(regarding promotion) but forgot to redesign the flyers so I told her to wait a bit longer. 

I got everyone to sign the cards and I think it'll look better than if it was just “The Common Senses” or myself. Lylia will give Mrs. H her card(they're familiar and she already knows Yarlyne and I are part of the project), Yarlyne will give Ms. E hers(cause i have too much contact with her), and I will give Mrs. Fett hers(since she's only familiar w me so far). Next time, Clarissa will definitely do some. I'd like to give her more tasks but I feel she's too occupied to complete them in time. I'll figure it out. I haven't thought about it that much to be honest. 

Got the cash box and gave it to Mrs. Tapia since Mrs. South wasn’t in her office or student store. I still think we should give 70% to the nonprofit so our transactions are easier to do. 

I really need to clean up my room a bit so I can upgrade my TCS box(it has everything TCS related or everything that belongs to TCS). 

Sent the email to that student that was interested in joining (Amelia Martin) with Remind, Google Classroom, and Instagram. She’s unable to go on Fridays but says she’d love the resources. 

Made the petals for purpose checklist too. And then, I was talking with chatgpt and I now know that Square gives free accounts with a free magstripe. I still have to do more research but I'm definitely considering it.

Made a documentation document for everyone else too. I thought we should do it all on one doc but I thought about it more and it'd be too overwhelming.  I need to figure out a better name than “documentation document” cause it sounds plain stupid. Whatever, I'll figure it out.
May 18, 2025
Finished writing thank you cards to Mrs. Hurlimann, Mrs. Fett, and Ms. Eichler. Mrs. H put our flyer onto The Sage, Mrs. F checked out our stand and heard us out even though she didn’t have any cash on her, and Ms. E allowed us to collaborate with her dance performance so we could get exposure to the community. Anyway, I’ve signed the cards, gotta get everyone else to sign them tomorrow. I was going to write one to Saenz and South but I think I'll wait till our last fundraiser. Remember!!
May 17, 2025
Yarlyne dropped off the roll of kraft paper so I cut up a bunch of bouquet wrappers.
May 16, 2025
I gave Mrs. South the receipts for Target, Walmart, and Dollar Tree. She sent a form to Mr Porter and I sent the debit card transaction screenshots to her. Mr Porter later told me he filled out the reimbursed form. I'll be receiving $44.40 by next week(according to her).

Our third fundraiser. We separated the funds 50/50. 50 to the club, 50 to the nonprofit. I forgot the amount so I'll count it later. Remember!! We got to watch the dance performance and it was really moving. I cried like 20 times. I got ignored a lot and I really need to better practice my charisma and vocal projection. I don’t think that’ll help but I really do need to work on it. Mrs. Fett checked out our stand and Mrs. Magee kinda ignored us. One of our friends’ parents checked out our stand(Mr. Le) and offered to be a guest speaker in cybersecurity. Both Yarlyne and I have his contact info but I'm having trouble figuring out what unit we should put it in. I kinda want to add another unit regarding internet use. I'll think about it and then consult with others. A student came to us, broke, but interested in our project. She gave us her contact info to send an email regarding how to join our club. Attendees were briefly George Porter, Ngoc Pham(Yarlyne’s mom, not mine), Yarlyne, and Myself.
May 15, 2025
I couldn't find the price stickers for the life of me, so I went to Walmart in the morning and bought the stickers and tape. I think we have everything packed.

Our second fundraiser. This one is at the bloom dance performance. This is an in-person fundraiser and we're selling succulents. We didn't have time to put prices on all the succulents yesterday so we did it today. This time, we have marbles and decor in our succulents so I think it'll sell better than last time. Unfortunately we're “competing” with the Dance cause they're selling flowers but I think we'll beat them in this aspect. We checked out their stand and they were $10 per bouquet! And they were store bought!!!! There's no way they are making profit. We made ~$86. A customer was complaining about how, at her job, some people couldn't even read a paycheck and we offered a position as a guest speaker next year. Her phone number is (619) 540-9117 and her name is Marie K. She's a CPA. Attendees were Lylia, Yarlyne, George Porter, Ngoc Pham(Yarlyne’s mom, not mine), Ngoc Pham(My mom), and myself.

Made this document today btw.
May 14, 2025
We're prepping for the fundraiser today. We went to Yarlyne’s house(her dad drove us) to get the hot glue gun but we couldn’t find the hot glue sticks so we went to Dollar Tree to get them but they didn't have any. Butttt, I found these acrylic sign stands that we can put our purpose and prices on which’ll look so much better than taping that huge sign to the table. Nobody really looks at the signs anyway. I’ve only noticed like 3 people so far. Then we went to Target and missed the aisle like 20 times. We got 2 packs of the mini hot glue sticks and headed to Yarlyne’s Aunt’s house. We picked which succulents we’d take, cut the paper, wrapped the succulents, rubber banded them, then thought of a new bow strategy where we glue on 1 ribbon around the circumference of the pot, tie a bow with a separate ribbon, glue the bow on, and you're done! So that fixed our issue with the bows slipping. Other than that, we had no issues. Attendees were Yarlyne, Yarlyne’s Aunt, Yarlyne’s Dad, Aaron Eyerly(my dad), and myself.

Yarlyne told me that she saw another person use the same flyer template as us so I believe I have to create our own art/template for our flyers. Unfortunate but it's ok. 
May 10, 2025
We rescheduled our succulent assembly day to today. We put together a bunch of succulent arrangements and ran out of pots so we went to the thrift store. It was too expensive there so we went to Dollar Tree and got a bunch of cheap pots, some pails, and a bigger metal pot. If they sell well, we’ll get more of them. I forgot to count how many again….. Whatever. Next time. Attendees were Yarlyne, Ngoc Pham(Yarlyne’s mom, not mine), Yarlyne’s Aunt, Aaron Eyerly(my dad), and myself.
